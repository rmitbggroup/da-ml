Datasets:
1. CIFAR10 can be downloaded by https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html. 
2. Other datasets are placed in folders with corresponding names. Due to the large file size of the Crop dataset, we split it into several small files. Before running experiment on Crop, need to run `cat WinnipegDataset.txt.* > WinnipegDataset.txt' first.


To run the code
1. run IAS： python IAS/main.py
2. run IAS-AMS： python IAS-AMS/main.py
